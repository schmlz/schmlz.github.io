We present a new algorithm for finding optimal deterministic policies for CSSPS called i2-dual-det and fill some technical gaps that have not been addressed before. In particular, we introduce a way to categorise how interesting a CSSPs constraints are (e.g., trivial if the constraints can be simply ignored) and we discuss how to cope with the big-M approach (it requires an upper bound that has, up to now, always been selected manually).
