CoGNeRe is solver for probabilistic shortest path problems. Akin to other replanners like Robust-FF,
CoGNeRe constructs a solution to the probabilistic problem by solving deterministic relaxations,
which lets it return partial policies quickly in an online fashion. The novelty is that by using
column generation, it can provide guarantees of optimality, and a lot of flexibility.

**Honours Thesis** [[pdf]({{ site.url }}/downloads/cognere/honours_thesis.pdf)]

100 page document that gives the background, and develops the main component of the algorithm. The
formulation is a bit outdated and the experiments are problematic (the version of Robust-FF that was
used for testing was hand-rolled without a lot of the optimisations in the authors' version), but
the theory is good. Submitted for the research component of my Honours Degree at ANU.
