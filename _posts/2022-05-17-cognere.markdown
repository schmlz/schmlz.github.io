CoGNeRe is solver for probabilistic shortest path problems. Akin to other replanners like Robust-FF,
CoGNeRe constructs a solution to the probabilistic problem by solving deterministic relaxations,
which lets it return partial policies quickly in an online fashion. The novelty is that by using
column generation, it can provide guarantees of optimality.

**Honours Thesis** [pdf]

<font color="#9097a3">

100 page document that gives the background, and develops the main component of the algorithm. The
experiments are a bit problematic, but the theory is good. Submitted for the research component of
Honours at ANU.
