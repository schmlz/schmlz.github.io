CG-iLAO* is a modification of the iLAO* algorithm, which is capable of using heuristics to ignore unpromising actions until they are needed.
In our experiments, CG-iLAO* outperforms iLAO* and LRTDP (the state-of-the-art).
To derive CG-iLAO* we view iLAO* under the lens of linear programming in a novel way, and generalise it with constraint generation.
Then, we bring this algorithm back into the world of dynamic programming.

I gave this talk in Toulouse and at Uni Basel. It steps through iLAO* and CG-iLAO* on a toy problem, which might be helpful to gain some intuition.
