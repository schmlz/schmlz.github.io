CG-iLAO* is a modification of the iLAO* algorithm, which is capable of using heuristics to ignore
unpromising actions until they are needed. In our experiments, CG-iLAO* outperforms iLAO* and LRTDP.
We derive CG-iLAO* by viewing iLAO* under the lens of linear programming, and then generalising it
at the linear programming level, and bring it back into a dynamic programming algorithm.
